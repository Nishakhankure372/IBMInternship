👨‍💻 Intern Details
Name: Nisha Khankure

Branch: Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering

Duration: 4 Weeks (15th July 2025 – 7th August 2025)

📖 About the Internship
This 4-week internship focused on AI and Cloud Computing fundamentals with a strong project-based approach. The structure included weekly live sessions, mentor guidance, and practical labs. The curriculum was as follows:

Week 1: Orientation, IBM Cloud Registration, AI Basics

Week 2: Data Analytics Concepts, Hands-on Labs, Cloud EDA

Week 3 & 4: ML/AI Experiments, AutoAI usage, Chatbot Building on IBM Cloud

Interns were expected to complete IBM SkillsBuild courses, attend all sessions, and submit a final capstone project. The internship was non-stipendiary but packed with valuable industry-level skills.

💡 Project: Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
🔍 Problem Statement
Modern networks face a variety of cyber threats, including DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R attacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect evolving threats in real time.

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze real-time network traffic and accurately identify malicious activities while distinguishing them from legitimate network behavior.

✅ Solution Overview
A complete ML-based solution was designed and deployed to monitor network traffic, detect attacks, and alert security personnel. The model was trained using the Kaggle Intrusion Detection Dataset and deployed on the IBM Cloud Lite platform using Watsonx.ai tools.

⚙️ Technology Stack
Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud Lite

AI/ML Service: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio

AutoML Tool: IBM AutoAI

Languages & Libraries:

Python

scikit-learn

pandas

XGBoost

ibm-watsonx-ai

🚀 Project Workflow
Dataset Acquisition

Kaggle dataset: Network Intrusion Detection

Data Preprocessing

Label encoding, missing value handling, normalization

Model Building

Trained multiple models using AutoAI

XGBoost was selected as the best performer

Model Evaluation

Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Generated confusion matrix for class-wise evaluation

Deployment

Deployed as a REST API service on IBM Watsonx.ai

Tested for real-time predictions

📊 Results
Achieved 95%+ accuracy in detecting and classifying intrusions

Real-time classification of network packets worked effectively

The deployed model is scalable and could be integrated into live network monitoring systems
